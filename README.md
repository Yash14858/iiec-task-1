# iiec-task-1
In this project the aim is to creat a Python program which can instruct your system to open or run some of their apps (like notepad,vlc,window media player,chrome,calendar,camera,calculator,firefox,maps,word pad,paint etc.) , and it can also open some social media platforms by using firefox browser(like Facebook,youtube,telegram,twitter,whatsapp,Instagram and also google search engine).

when you run this program a string will appear "Tell me what can i do for you:",
now you have to give intstructions to run your apps in your system.
 
 for example:-
            Tell me what can i do for you: can you please run notepad for me

       (after getting your instructions this program will open notepad for you)
